Operation Bugle Boy is very fortunate to be able to team up with the St. Martins Knights of Columbus to host a seminar titled **The Price of Freedom:  Our Gold Star Families**.  This special event will take place on the evening of Thursday, November 5, 2020, beginning at 6 p.m., at the St. Martins Knights of Columbus Hall.

With Jeremy Amick serving as the Master of Ceremonies, this seminar will feature brief presentations from a panel that will include local members of Gold Star Families.  Major General Hank Stratman, U.S. Army retired, will also share words of inspiration about why we must never forget the servicemen and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country.

*Other Highlights & Information*
In addition to a great program, this event will feature a Wall of Honor displaying photos of nearly 100 local heroes who have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country, and Leon’s Patriot Tree (please see more information about Leon’s Patriot Tree below).  *Coffee and pie will be served to those in attendance beginning at 6 p.m., with the seminar program starting at approximately 6:45 p.m.*

*Only 200 Tickets Available & They Are Free!*

Abraham Lincoln once said, “A nation that does not honor its heroes will not long endure.”  Operation Bugle Boy feels the same way about our Gold Star Families.  **Please attend The Price of Freedom:  Our Gold Star Families** and help make sure that we as a community never forget the legacy of the heroes, and their families, who are most responsible for the freedoms we enjoy.

Coffee & Pie Reception begins at 6 p.m.!
