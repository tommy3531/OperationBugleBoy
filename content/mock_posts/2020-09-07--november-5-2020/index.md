Abraham Lincoln once said, "A nation that does not honor its heroes will not long endure."  Operation Bugle Boy feels that same way about our Gold Star Families.  Please attend The Proce of Freedom: Out Gold Star Families and help make sure that we as a community never forget the legacy of the heroes, and their families, who are most responsible for the freedoms we enjoy.
